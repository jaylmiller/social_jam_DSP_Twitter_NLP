SocialJam - Trevor Aron, Jay Miller, George Danforth

SocialJam applies effects to audio signals in real time. Effects parameters are controlled through a web interface. SocialJam can also be enabled to respond to live tweets (from an audience for example). It does this through sentiment analysis of incoming tweet. The effects are then determined by an aggregate score of each tweets sentiment score. A low score will produce scary dark sounding tones that are highly effected, while a more neutral score will have a less effected sound, a high score will produce a highly effected sound as well, although this one is intended to sound happy/euphoric.
